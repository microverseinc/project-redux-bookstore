# Milestone 1

## Introduction
You need to build the foundation of your project, and because this project does not differ much from the React Calculator you built before, we'll start by using the `create-react-app` package to facilitate setting everything up.

## Requirements

1. Use `create-react-app` to initialize a new React app
    - Documentation: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. Delete any unnecessary file or asset
3. Add the necessary packages to your project:
    - Add `react-redux` using npm.
    - Add `redux` using npm.
    - Add [`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) using npm for [typechecking props](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).
4. Run the application with `npm start` and make sure that everything works correctly.
5. Follow the instructions in `create-react-app-buildpack` to deploy the app to Heroku
    - Initialize a git repo
    - Create a Heroku app
    - Commit and deploy to Heroku
    - Make sure the Heroku app works correctly
    - Push everything to Github
